# Python-Sql data visualization and anaylisis

### These are some projects i´ve done using python with sql data bases

* Python-sql file  is a clustering analysis of a table i made in mysql workbench
* Northwind database, something pretty basic just visualizing the data using visual studio code

>My main purpose was to mix sql data bases with the knowledge i have in python so i could analyze it

### I used:
* Mysql workbench 
* Visual Studio code with the jupyer notebook extension
* Python as the main language
