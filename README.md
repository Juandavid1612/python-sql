# python-sql

Some visualization and data analysis projects iÂ´ve done using python with sql data bases

- Python -sql file  is a clustering analysis of a table i made in mysql workbench
- Northwind database, something pretty basic just visualizing the data using visual studio code

  My main purpose was to mix sql data bases with the knowledge i have in python so i could analyze it
